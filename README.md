## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values & outliers.
- Visualizing engagement trends over time.
- Analyzing hashtag impact on reach and impressions.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **Regression Model**: Predicting Instagram post reach.
- **Classification Model**: Identifying high-engagement posts.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Posts with **higher engagement rates** tend to have specific hashtag patterns.
- **Time of posting** plays a crucial role in reach and impressions.
- **Carousel posts** tend to perform better than single-image posts.

## 📌 How to Use
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook instagram_reach_analysis.ipynb
```
Modify hyperparameters in `src/model_training.py` to experiment with different models.
